# Box packing with Everyday items Dataset

This dataset is a collection of human experts packing groceries into a box. 
BoxED was collected in Virtual Reality (VR) and captures many parameters of this task,
including 6-DOF pick-and-place grasp poses, object trajectories, packing sequence and more. 
This dataset enables learning models for multiple aspects of this task from humans, that generate human-like behaviors.
